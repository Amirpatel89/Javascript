	// functions are just blocks of code that can be called/used whenever you please.
	// 1. They are first class objects.. you can do anything to a function that you can do to any other object.
	// 2. They have their own scrope. I.e., it is a child of whoever it's inside of.
	// Children can see their parents stuff, and can override their parents stuff.
	// 3. Like all other variables, if it's not insdie of something, it belongs to the global scope, or window.
	// 4. They can return a single value (can be an object, array)

	// function getRand(low, high){
	// 	var rand = Math.ceil(Math.random() * high) + low;
	// 	return rand;
	// }

	// function isPrime(n, knownPrimes){
	// 	for(let n = ...)

	// }
 //    var callMe = function(){
 //    	console.log("Call Me!")
 //    }


	// console.log(getRand(9,13));
